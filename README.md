#Version 2 of yesterday's daily assignment

##Updates
* Replace the <Link> components in your BaseLayout component with <NavLink> components and apply your own styling to differentiate them when they are active (see HINTS).

* Use exact path to render your splash index page (your App.js component).

* Create two more components - a Contact.js component and a References.js component.

* Contacts should render a page with mock contact information.
* Contacts should have links to an email, Facebook, GitHub, Phone, etc. (these can be mock or your own).
* References should render a list of 3-5 references from past mock employers.
* Each "reference" should include a name, contact info, and lorem ipsum (or mock recommendations if you are inclined) as their recommendations.
* Add a two more <NavLink>'s to your navigation bar in your <BaseLayout> and create content for them.

* Add a link to Contact.
* Add a link to References.
